Firebase serve -> run server
firebase init
firebase use projectID -> to connect
npm install firebase
I could not run firebase deploy --only firestore:rules because my firebase.json file was not initialized with defaults.

{
  "hosting": {
    "public": ".",
    "ignore": [
      "firebase.json",
      "**/.*",
      "**/node_modules/**"
    ]
  }
}

{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "public"
  }
}
